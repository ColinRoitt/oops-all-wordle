## Tech
Bare bones static react and redux - no other libraries.

Pretty simply made available to play around with - go do whatever with it. 

Bonus points if you can

```
A - Figure out (without cheating and looking at the util file) how the URL word encoding works. It's not complicated just enough to obfuscate it from the user

B - Use this to evolve an agent to play this game because that's just fun
```

somethign something no affiliation with whoever etc
